Log Summary Script

A script to read a file given with name given as command line argument and present the data sumarised and ordered.

app.rb holds a script and uses a single class in an asscoiated file.
calling app the script initalizes the class and calls the methods to create an output of the summary in the command line.


No gems are used so it is easily called with ruby

Tests though are done with rspec in the spec folder. Using these will require the rspec gem installed which I haven't included here.
This is my first attempt at writing rspec tests any feedback would be appreciated
